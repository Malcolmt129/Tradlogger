This is my attempt at making journaling trades much more easier and efficient. I am using the Qt framework and I'll be doing some of the work in VS code and some in QT creator.

I think that I'm going to scrap the whole QT thing. I can make a better UI with web dev stuff. So what I started was a react fropntend and a Django backend. The reason is because I would still like to implement some of the features of python into this project.

I tried to use Django and it is not as straight forward for my use case. All that I need is to make a couple of endpoints. Django provides a
whole admin thing. I need something simpler to get started as of right now.

It seems as though I should just use exspress js for the backend. I can invoke python functions from javascript. And it seems as though there is a lot to do to have a python backend. So the decision comes from me wanting the simplicity of creating a UI with javascript and node, but I want the data reading that python can do. I really dont know what tf I'm doing...
